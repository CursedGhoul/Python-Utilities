<h1>Welcome, to our technically a local webpage.</h1>
<body>This is the local page for Python Utilities, where we may place information or otehr things. This will be longer and have a description for most utilities that are currently in the repo.
    Calculator:
                Pretty self explanatory, a very basic text-based calculator written in Python because this is Python utilities. This will probably be the only non-Python file on here. It is a multi-operational calculator that looks like it was from the time of horizontal, yellowed, computers. Use it for a reminder of the past.
            
    Random Number: 
                It generates a random number between the two minimum and maximum selected numbers</body>

    Grade:
        It will show you a letter grade based on a percentage inputted.</body>

        <h1>These are our current main utilities described.</h1>
