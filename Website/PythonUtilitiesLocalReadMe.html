<h1>Welcome, to our technically a local webpage.</h1>
<body>This is the local page for Python Utilities, where we may place information or otehr things. This will be longer and have a description for most utilities that are currently in the repo.
    Calculator:
                Pretty self explanatory, a very basic text-based calculator written in Python because this is Python utilities. It is a multi-operational calculator that looks like it was from the time of horizontal, yellowed, computers. Use it for a reminder of the past.
            
    Random Number: 
                It generates a random number between the two minimum and maximum selected numbers</body>

    Grade:
        It will show you a letter grade based on a percentage inputted.
    
    Consonant Counter:
                     Counts consonants in an inputted word
    
    Vowel Counter:
                Counts vowels in an inputted word</body>
    
    Password Checker:
                    Check how good your passwords are, written in Python, if you don't wanna give it your password, don't give it your password. It is all open source, so you can see it

    Password Generator:
                    Generate a completely random password. All open source so you can see if we log it (we don't)

        <h1>These are our current main utilities described.</h1>
